Dataset Link: Please contact abhinav@iitrpr.ac.in or monisha.21csz0023@iitrpr.ac.in to get access to EngageNet dataset. 

About the dataset:
- Large scale dataset EngageNet has around 31 hours of data of 127 subjectst (83 males and 44 females), and over 11.3K 10-sec clips.
- The participants were between the age range of 18 to 37 years.
- A web based platform was designed for the data collection study.
- The participant could use the web based interface anywhere they felt comfortable. This enabled collection of data in diverse environments.
- The participants in the videos were assigned to different engagement classes by a group of three annotators.
- The four different engagement classes are "Highly-Engaged", "Engaged", "Barely-Engaged", and "Not-Engaged".
- We created subject independent data split leading to 90 participants in Train, 11 participants in Validation, and 26 participants in Test.
- There are a total of 7983 Train, 1071 Validation, and 2257 Test videos.
